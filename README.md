DyBa ORF {#mainpage}
--------
DyBa ORF is a Dynamically Balanced Online Random Forest, which addresses three problems in learning with Random Forests:  
* Online learning. It can accept gradually arrived training data and update the model on-the-fly.
* Data imbalance. It deals with imbalanced data of different classes, avoiding low correct rate of classification for minor class.
* Changing imbalance ratio. The ratio (degree) of imbalance may dynamically change when new training data arrive sequentially. Compared with traditionaly Online Random Forest (Saffari, A. 2009, Barinova, O. 2012) which assumes the imblance ratio do not change,
    DyBa ORF updates the model dynamically with the ability to be adapted to new imbalance ratio.

DyBa ORF was was developed as part of the [GIFT-Surg][giftsurg] project. The algorithm and software were developed by [Guotai Wang][guotai] at the [Translational Imaging Group][tig] in the [Centre for Medical Image Computing][cmic] at [University College London (UCL)][ucl].

System requirements
-------------------

The current version of DyBa ORF requries:
* A C++ compiler installed and configured to work with cmake.
* Cmake to generate the project from source code.

How to use
-------------------

- 1, Suppose the source code directory is $DyBaORF, create a new folder named "build" under that.
- 2, Switch to the $DyBaORF directory.
- 3, Open Cmake, set the source code directory as $DyBaORF, and set the build directory as $DyBaORF/build.
- 4, Click Configure, select the c++ compile you use. (VS in Windows, Clang++ in Mac, gcc in Linux)
- 5, Click Generate to generate the project, which can be found at $DyBaORF/build.
- 6, Go to $DyBaORF/build to open the generated project, compile it and then you can run it.
